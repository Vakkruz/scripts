#SBP-IT Scripts

This repo contains scripts that were created by myself during this time working at St. Benedict's Prep. These scripts were created to speed up our yearly tasks of cleaning up graduated students and adding new ones.

There are three:
* Bulk Creation - Creates new accounts from CSV file and adds them to specified security/distribution groups
* Bulk Password - To be run after Google Sync; Sets proper password for accounts in CSV file that will be distributed to parents. For security, file is deleted after the program is complete
* Bulk Removal  - Removes accounts in specified OU from a security/distribution group in AD
